# Overview:
This page will contain brief descriptions of the projects that I undertake with links to the in-depth documentation. As I progress in my learning, so too will the complexity and scope of the projects.

# Projects:

## [Secure Office Network Deployment](.Fahim602/_projects/secure-office-network-deployment)

### Project Overview:
- **Network Planning & Setup**: Designed and built a network with two departments (HR and IT) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **VLAN Configuration**: Configured VLANs for traffic isolation and set up routing between them.
- **Security Implementation**: Applied port security, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and SSH for secure network management.
- **Testing & Mitigation**: Simulated a security breach (rogue DHCP server) and mitigated it using tools like DHCP snooping.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- **Networking**: IP addressing, subnetting, VLAN configuration, inter-VLAN routing.
- **Security**: Port security, ACLs, SSH management.
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing and resolving network issues, including rogue DHCP servers.
- **Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer, CLI, DHCP snooping.
