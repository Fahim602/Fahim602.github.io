# Projects:

## [Secure Office Network Deployment](/projects/Secure-Office-Network-Deployment/secure-office-network-deployment.md).

### Project Overview:
This project focused on designing and securing a multi-department office network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The goal was to create a functional network by incorporating several key network features such as subnetting, VLANs, DHCP and NAT, while also implementing security measures such as Port Security and Access Control Lists to prevent unauthorised access.

- **Network Planning & Setup**: **Designed and built a network** with three departments (IT, HR, and Management).  
- **VLAN Configuration**: Configured VLANs for traffic isolation and **implemented Router on a Stick (ROAS)** for communication between them
- **Security Implementation**: Applied **Port Security, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and SSH** for secure network management.
- **Security Validation**: Tested ACLs, SSH restrictions, and Port Security to verify access control policies.  

### Skills Demonstrated:
- **Networking**: IP addressing, subnetting, VLAN configuration, inter-VLAN routing.
- **Security**: Port security, ACLs for traffic filtering, SSH for secure remote management.
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing and resolving network issues, including rogue DHCP servers.
- **Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer, CLI for network configuration and testing
